Premise: A self-hosted portfolio website 🚀
Hosted on Ubuntu server 🐧, currently crafting server network configs and battling with permissions. But hey, a server grants immense freedom for website possibilities once deployment hurdles are conquered.

## The Plot 📜
I've embraced the world of three.js again and ventured into the realm of shaders (GLSL). Picture this: a captivating hover effect over cards guiding users to various sections of the website, each adorned with a shader that vibes with the content.

If we stick with an analog aesthetic:

Wires for technology ⚡
Film for photography 📷
Vinyl for music 🎶 - imagine a spinning three.js spine, music playing on hover. Groovy, right?
Envisioning grain and textures to add that extra flair.

Development of the front end kicks off in a few days. Meanwhile, I'm building the ultimate homeserver, creating a juicy environment for this beauty. Stay tuned for updates! 🌐✨
