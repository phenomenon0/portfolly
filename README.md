 ### Premise A self hosted portfolio website 
hosted on ubuntu server
currently building the server network configs and permissions are a pain.
but a server affords so much freedom in what is possible in a website once deployment
and environmental variables are removed a lot of freedom is unleashed on the
developer. Watch this space.

### The plot 
I have decided to go back to my beloved three.js library and I have recently begun learning shaders or should I say GLSL 
A simple hover effect over cards leading to different sections of the website 
With shader hover effect for each one that matches the vibe.

If we stick with an analog aesthetic then wires for technology,
film for photography,
vinyl for music -- spinning three.js spine?  music on hover
I envision grain and some textures. 

Developement of the front end should start in a few days I continue to build the homeserver 
setting up a juicy environment for this beaut.
