# portfolly
 A self hosted portfolio website 
 hosted on ubuntu server
currently building the server network configs and permissions are a pain.
but a server affords so much freedom in what is possible in a website once deployment
and environmental variables are removed a lot of freedom is unleashed on the
developer. Watch this space.
